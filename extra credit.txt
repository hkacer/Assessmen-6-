Local Development Environment: This is the environment where developers write and test code for the web application. This could be a laptop, desktop, or virtual machine running on a local machine.

Version Control (e.g. GitHub): Developers use version control systems such as Git and GitHub to track changes to the codebase and collaborate with other team members.

Continuous Integration (CI): As developers make changes to the codebase, they can push their changes to the repository on GitHub. This triggers a process called continuous integration, which automatically builds and tests the code to ensure that it is ready for deployment.

Staging Environment: After the code has been successfully built and tested, it is deployed to a staging environment for further testing. This environment is typically a replica of the production environment, and is used to ensure that the code is ready for deployment to production.

Production Environment: The production environment is where the web application is actually hosted and made available to users. This could be a server or cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure.

The different parts of the web application, such as the front-end (client-side) code, the back-end (server-side) code, and any databases or other resources, are typically deployed as part of this process.

In this sketch, the web application goes through several stages as it is developed and eventually deployed to production.

The first stage is the local development environment, where developers work on their own machines to build and test the web application.

From there, the code is typically version-controlled using a tool like GitHub, which allows multiple developers to collaborate on the project and track changes to the codebase.

Once the code is ready for testing, it is pushed to the staging environment, where it is tested by QA teams to ensure that it meets the required specifications and works as expected.

If the code passes testing, it is then deployed to the production environment, where it is accessible to end users.

It's worth noting that this is just one example of a deployment process, and different organizations and projects may have different approaches to deployment.
